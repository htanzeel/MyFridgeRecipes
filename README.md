MyFridgeRecipes
===============

A Mobile Application for Android is proposed and developed to provide assistance to the users in cooking a meal. 
Application helps the users to come up with a recipe from the ingredients available in their fridge which is 
accomplished by using the Yummly API. The application displays the retrieved recipes from various blogs and 
websites via the Yummly API, in a simple textual form. It relieves the user from the hassle of searching the 
grocery stores to buy the additional ingredients in the recipe, by displaying the nearest stores on the map via 
Google and Place API. Facebook is integrated with the application to let the users share their thoughts about the
recipe. During the design and development of the system, several concepts of the Component Based Software course 
have been used, in particular the architectural styles. The application is developed using the Java programming 
language under the development environment of Eclipse. The result is an application that can be used by people 
to save time while cooking.
